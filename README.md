Booki is a travel agency company that is now expanding its business and has selected you as the web developer for this exciting project.

The team consists of:

Alex, the CTO overseeing the development of the new website.
Sophia, the UX designer responsible for creating the site’s user interface.
Lena, the sales representative tasked with connecting with restaurants.
You, the web developer responsible for building the site.
Lena is currently reaching out to restaurants for the project. When you meet her at the coffee machine, she says:

"Have you heard the news? Remember the sales manager at your favorite restaurant? I convinced him and three others to put their menus online! I'll send you the files with the four menus this afternoon. It’s all in your hands now!"

With the team, you decide that the prototype will include these four menus.

Here is the brief you put together with the CTO, Alex. When you return to your desk, you find the site mock-ups in your inbox, sent by Sophia.
